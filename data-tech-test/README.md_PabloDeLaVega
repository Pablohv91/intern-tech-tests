I'm using Pycharm as my IDE.

1. Change :
'''
orders = pd.read_csv('../orders.csv', header=0)
'''
../ to be able to read the csv file

2. Change :
'''
orders[col_name] = pd.Series(value)
'''
Code to implement the Country's list, adding .Series just in case the list doesn't match the length of the rows.

3. Change :
'''
ow_sc, high_sc = [amount for x, amount in orders.groupby(orders['amount'] >= threshold)]
'''
Code dividing the DataSeries into two, with the input provided before, in case the data is larger than expected and you want to analyse it from different points of view.

4. Change :
'''
    amount_list = data["amount"]
    threshold_list = [price for price in amount_list]
    threshold_split = int(input(f"Which amount would you like to split it {threshold_list} ? "))
    low_spending_customers, high_spending_customers = transformer.split_customers(data, threshold_split)
'''
Asking to choose from a the list amount spend -> esto no entiendo lo que quiere decir, quizas  "This asks you to choose from the list the amount spent" ?

5. Change :
'''
sns.relplot(data=orders,
            x="customer",
            y="amount",
            hue="date")
plt.show()
'''
This allows you to see the data from a visual point of view and get different insights. For example, the fact that Sam and Sara both made an order on the same day.

6. Change :
Code to solve the bonus task
